# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What does CRUD stand for?

  Your answer: Create, Read, Update ,Delete.

  Researched answer: CRUD is an acronym that stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four most basic operations that can be performed with most traditional database systems and they are the backbone for interacting with any database. 



2. What are the 5 HTTP verbs?

  Your answer: post, get, put, patch, delete

  Researched answer: The primary or most-commonly-used HTTP verbs (or methods, as they are properly called) are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.



3. When creating a basic (stateless) class component in React, what are the necessary elements needed to render "Hello World" on the page?

  Your answer: Return & <h1,p,footer etc...><.../>, and if you have multiple elements, a <div> tag to wrap around it.

  Researched answer: A functional(a.k.a. stateless) component is just a plain javascript function which takes props as an argument and returns a react element.



4. What is JSX?

  Your answer: It is essentially Reacts own version of HTML to display a web-page using react.

  Researched answer: JSX is an XML/HTML-like syntax used by React that extends ECMAScript so that XML/HTML-like text can co-exist with JavaScript/React code.



5. What is the difference between React state and props?

  Your answer: State is essentially an object with keys/variables for your component to use, and props are information from one components state being passed to another component.

  Researched answer: In a React component, props are variables passed to it by its parent component. State on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I have absolutely no clue.

  Researched answer:Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Inevitably, this means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.
